## Introduction
Packages 

***We learned that modules are files containing Python statements and definitions, like function and class definitions. We will learn in this chapter how to bundle multiple modules together to form a package.***

***A package is basically a directory with Python files and a file with the name __init__.py. This means that every directory inside of the Python path, which contains a file named __init__.py, will be treated as a package by Python. It's possible to put several modules into a Package.***

***Packages are a way of structuring Pythonâ€™s module namespace by using "dotted module names". A.B stands for a submodule named B in a package named A. Two different packages like P1 and P2 can both have modules with the same name, let's say A, for example. The submodule A of the package P1 and the submodule A of the package P2 can be totally different. A package is imported like a "normal" module. We will start this chapter with a simple example.***
